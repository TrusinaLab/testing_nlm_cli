Across the animal kingdom, during the early phases of development, the embryo lays out a coordinate system with axes from head to tail, from belly to back, and from left to right. Generally, this entails the transformation of a uniform group of cells into a head-tail elongated structure organised into three fundamental tissue types (germ layers) along the other two axes. While this process — gastrulation — can differ dramatically between species, there are remarkable overlaps in how symmetries are broken and cells are patterned (Box 1).

Most species do not simply inherit their coordinate system through molecular gradients from the mother but instead rely on self-organising mechanisms. Here we focus on three principles of self-organisation that are fundamental to gastrulation across amniotes (Box 1): First, the early embryo breaks symmetry to establish the future anterior (A, head) and posterior (P, tail) poles. Second, this broken symmetry is resolved into an elongated AP-axis that spans the embryo. Third, the initially uniform cell population (the epiblast) is patterned into three distinct germ layers and positioned along the AP-axis.

During gastrulation, cells rearrange globally, proliferate extensively, and respond to dynamic signalling gradients. Despite this, the resulting morphology and patterning are remarkably robust. Decades of work have identified the molecular signals involved, yet we have not determined which mechanisms actively drive gastrulation.

Computational modeling offers a way to test candidate drivers and assess whether they suffice to replicate specific aspects of gastrulation. To date, continuum mechanics approaches capture global tissue flows, while reaction-diffusion models describe gradient-driven patterning. However, cell patterning and morphogenetic movements continuously influence each other and cannot be treated independently.

Capturing how cells are patterned as they move requires bridging the dynamically changing 3D geometry of the embryo with concurrent intra-, inter-, and global-scale cell regulation. Discrete models — such as particle-based and vertex-based approaches — achieve this by letting 3D morphologies emerge from cell-cell interactions (Box 2) [ref].

In this review we discuss recent advances in computational modeling of gastrulation in chick, mouse, and in vitro systems of mouse and human gastrulation, with the goal of identifying the mechanisms that drive amniote gastrulation. We also discuss efforts in *Drosophila* that address how distinct domains and subprocesses interact during gastrulation.
